There I was, working on the multiclass AUROC code with Clayton for our upcoming publication when suddenly, I get an email. Golly,
it's from Benjamin! Ben never emails me at this time... he only ever pops in to ask how many drugs I've found and to

were in an inappropriate format. And so my mission, as I have chosen to accept it, is to format the dates correctly.

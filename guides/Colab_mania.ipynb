Provided GPUs include Nvidia K80s, T4s, P4s and P100s. The amount of available memory changes in accordance to the provided VM. Another limitation is the idle period; Google Colab will end sessions and disconnect from runtime if it detects no activity for a variable amount of time (90 minutes according to [this Stackexchange post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54057011/google-colab-session-timeout)).

After executing the script you should be able to clone into any public or private repos you have been given permission to access. Whether or not Colab's automatic session termination after the idle limit is exceeded still persists has been untested, so for now you probably have to baby the VM and Colab session upon sshing in."
